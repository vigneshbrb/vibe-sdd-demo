# Campus Event Registration

This repository is a simple demo for a Campus Event Registration system built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs entirely in the browser and uses `localStorage` to keep track of registrations.

## Features

- Register a student for an event (email and student name must each be unique across all events)
- View current registrations
- Cancel a registration
- Simple, clean UI with no dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces (or any static file server environment).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. If you're in Codespaces, click on the file and choose "Open in Browser" from the file menu.
3. Use the form to add registrations. They will appear below the form.
4. Click **Cancel** next to an entry to remove it.

## File Overview

- `index.html` - main page with UI and inline styling
- `script.js` - client-side logic for managing registrations
- `app.js` - currently unused (left for potential extensions)

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs!
